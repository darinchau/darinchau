\begin{SectionTable}{\headingfont Research experience}
Sep 2022 - Dec 2022 &
\textbf{Cluster algebra} (Algebraic Geometry/Algebraic Combinatorics - Math) \newline
Supervised by Prof. Ivan Ip. This research project investigates the positivity theorem of cluster algebras and the combinatorial tools developed by Gross et. al. for the proof.
\\ 
Jun 2022 - Aug 2022 &
\textbf{Crowd Counting using CNN} (Machine Learning - CS) \newline
Supervised by Prof. Gary Chan Sheung-Han. This research project investigates the Parasite-Host CNN model developed by Meng et. al. for video crowd counting. We developed a synthetic dataset to test the model with datasets of 4K resolution, and suggested slightly modified model structure that might lead to better results.
\\
Feb 2022 - May 2022 &
\textbf{Cluster algebra} (Algebraic Geometry/Algebraic Combinatorics - Math) \newline
Supervised by Prof. Ivan Ip. This research project investigates the cluster algebraic structure over tensor invariant rings. We developed a theorem about the classification for the case \(n = 9\) and made conjectures about the underlying graph structure of the mutation graphs of the cluster algebras.
